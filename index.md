Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Mark Bernhofen, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of Oxford** and the **LSE**, specializing in climate risk and adaptation analytics for decision-making.

At Oxford, I work as part of the **Oxford Program for Sustainable Infrastructure Systems** where I lead a project focussed on *just adaptation* that quantifies the unequal impacts of climate risks to infrastructure in developing countries and develops data, metrics, and tools to support decision makers to make equitable adaptation decisions.

I also have a joint (part-time) position at the LSE, working at the **Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment**. My research at LSE explores how climate risk and adaptation can be integrated into credit rating methodologies, from the sovereign to the project level. 

My research is fairly multi-disciplinary, I have a background in engineering, my PhD (at the **University of Leeds**) was in global flood risk modelling, and I now do work at the intersection of climate risk and finance. I've listed some of my research interests below, please do get in touch if you are interested on collaborating on anything!

**Research Interests**
- The integration of climate risk and adaptation models with social vulnerability data
- Modelling the impacts of climate extremes on infrastructure systems.
- Combining global and local data to model climate risk in data scarce regions
- Understanding and mitigating climate risk to forcibly displaced populations
- The integration of climate, economic, and financial risk models
- Flood model validation and evaluation
- Ethics and responsible use of climate data for decision making
