I am a PostDoc researcher at the **University of Oxford** and the **London School of Economics**, specializing in climate risk and adaptation analytics. My work focuses on developing quantitative approaches to assess climate risks and design effective adaptation strategies, bridging environmental science, economics, and policy.

I develop innovative methodologies for climate risk assessment, focusing on both physical climate risks and the economic implications of climate change. My research aims to provide decision-makers with the analytical tools they need to build climate resilience in an uncertain world.
