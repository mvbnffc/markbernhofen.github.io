## Teaching Philosophy

I believe students learn best by doing. In my teaching I try to marry traditional lecturing with hands-on simulations. Particularly when it comes to teaching climate risk, I find it valuable to let students experience first-hand the trade-offs and uncertainties that come with using climate information for real-world decision-making. 

Below I've included a couple recent teaching highlights (with nice photos or videos). For a full list of my teaching experience, please take a look at my CV.

## A Few Teaching Highlights

### Simulating climate financing decisions with *actual* government decision-makers

In June 2025, I was invited to run a day's course on climate change and climate finance for the Small Countries Financial Management Program on the Isle of Man. This program brings together around 20 government officials from different small countries to build capacity around financial management. 

Many of these countries are on the frontlines of climate change, and my day-long course was a crash course in climate change fundamentals, risk assessment approaches, and climate finance. We finished the day with a simulation where the participants were assigned a fictional small country with unique financial constraints and climate risks and asked to design a national climate finance strategy. I've inlcuded the materials from that simulation in the links below, in case you are interested in running a similar session youself. Please send me an email if you have any questions!

**Course Materials:**

- [Climate Financing Cards](#) - /assets/teaching-materials/climate_financing_cards.pdf

### A NASA training course for assessing flood risk to refugee camps. 

Following, our paper on assissing flood risk to refugee camps in Ethiopia, NASA reached out to me and my co-authors and asked if we'd be willing to put together a training course for their Applied Remote Sensing Training Program (ARSET). The program was attended live by over 800 participants and is still available online. I have embedded the training video below and added links to the training material.
