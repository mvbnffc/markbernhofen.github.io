## Research Ethos

My research is driven by the belief that climate science must translate into actionable insights for decision-makers. I focus on developing quantitative methodologies that bridge the gap between climate projections and practical adaptation planning. By combining rigorous analytical approaches with real-world applications, I aim to provide tools that help communities, businesses, and governments build resilience in the face of climate uncertainty.

I believe in open science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensuring that research outputs are accessible to those who need them most. My work spans the intersection of environmental science, economics, and policy, always with an eye toward practical implementation and measurable impact.

## Completed Research

### An asset-level analysis of financial tail risks under extreme weather events (2025)
*Environmental Research: Climate* | [Paper Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/addf6f) | [Code](https://github.com/rubenkerkhofs/PRISK)

In this paper we introduce an open-source, modular, methodology for translating extreme climate risks into financial risks at the asset, firm, and portfolio level.

### Data, guidelines and ethics for managing flood risk when people are already forcibly displaced (2024)
*Environmental Research Letters* | [Paper Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad9e06/meta)

In this paper we highlight some of the challenges with managing flood risk for people who are forcibly displaced. We then provide some recommendations for how flood risk should be effectively managed in these contexts.
