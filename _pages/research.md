## Research Ethos

My research is driven by the belief that climate science must translate into actionable insights for decision-makers. I focus on developing quantitative methodologies that bridge the gap between climate projections and practical adaptation planning. By combining rigorous analytical approaches with real-world applications, I aim to provide tools that help communities, businesses, and governments build resilience in the face of climate uncertainty.

I believe in open science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensuring that research outputs are accessible to those who need them most. My work spans the intersection of environmental science, economics, and policy, always with an eye toward practical implementation and measurable impact.
