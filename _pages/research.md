## Research Ethos

My research is driven by the belief that climate science must translate into actionable insights for decision-makers. I focus on developing quantitative methodologies that bridge the gap between climate projections and practical adaptation planning. By combining rigorous analytical approaches with real-world applications, I aim to provide tools that help communities, businesses, and governments build resilience in the face of climate uncertainty.

I believe in open science, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensuring that research outputs are accessible to those who need them most. My work spans the intersection of environmental science, economics, and policy, always with an eye toward practical implementation and measurable impact.

## Completed Research

### An asset-level analysis of financial tail risks under extreme weather events (2025)
*Environmental Research: Climate* | [Paper Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/addf6f) | [Code](https://github.com/rubenkerkhofs/PRISK)

In this paper we introduce an open-source, modular, methodology for translating extreme climate risks into financial risks at the asset, firm, and portfolio level.

### Data, guidelines and ethics for managing flood risk when people are already forcibly displaced (2024)
*Environmental Research Letters* | [Paper Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad9e06/meta)

In this paper we highlight some of the challenges with managing flood risk for people who are forcibly displaced. We then provide some recommendations for how flood risk should be effectively managed in these contexts.

### Unknown risk: assessing refugee camp flood risk in Ethiopia (2023)
*Environmental Research Letters* | [Paper Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acd8d0)

In this paper we explore how global flood risk data can be used to understand flood risk to refugee camps in Ethiopia. We find that some global datasets are unsuitable for this task. However, when combined with local data such assessments can be informative. Applying this approach in Ethiopia, we find over 180,000 refugees are exposed to flooding, affecting 24 (96%) of camps in the country.

### The role of global data sets for riverine flood risk management at national scales (2022)
*Water Resources Research* | [Paper Link](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021WR031555)

In this paper we explore how global flood risk datasets could inform national flood risk management. An intercomparison of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability datasets in five countries reveals significant uncertainty in the resultant national flood risk estimates. We advocate for a multi-model approach. This quantitative analysis was complimented by interviews with flood risk management stakeholders across the five countries which revealed the importance of the right institutional frameworks in place to ensure the effective use of global data nationally

### Global flood exposure from different sized rivers (2021)
*Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences* | [Paper Link](https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/21/2829/2021/)

In this paper we developed a terrain-based global river flood hazard model to estimate the impact of river size representation on global and national flood exposure estimates. We found that the size of river that is modelled in global flood models has a significant imapct on flood exposure estimates, differing by up to a factor of 2 globally.
